# BLOG A-P

Hey there person! I hope you're doing well :)

Welcome to my blog. I don't have a lot of stuff here yet, rather there's just one post. This blog runs on the same engine that powers [research.if-m](https://research.if-m.works). 

insert: Here's my first blog post! (WIP)
[Reflecting, Recaping and Wrapping up 2025](./pages/wrapping_2025.md)



### Here is a codeblock
Codeblocks are runnable
```js-run
import {test} from "./test.js"
document.body.style.backgroundColor = 'beige'
document.body.style.fontFamily = 'monospace'
document.body.innerHTML = test
console.log("running")
```

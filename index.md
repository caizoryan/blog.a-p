# BLOG

Hey there person! I hope you're doing well :)

Welcome to my blog. I don't have a lot of stuff here yet, rather there's just one post. This blog runs on the same engine that powers [research.if-m](https://research.if-m.works). 

insert: Here's my first blog post! (WIP)
[Reflecting, Recaping and Wrapping up 2025](./pages/wrapping_2025.md)

### Here is a codeblock
Codeblocks are runnable :) play around!

```js-run
let body = document.body

body.style.backgroundColor = 'beige'
body.style.fontFamily = 'monospace'
body.innerHTML = "<h1>Hello world!</h1>"

console.log("running")
console.log("check console")
```

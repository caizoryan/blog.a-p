<p > Wanted to do this as an exercise+practice in static site generation. Maybe even an opportunity to make a static site generator. </p>
<p > While making this, as you can see above on the right, I highlighted  comments all of which start with SECTION mark. Wondering about a Neovim shortcut which will jumpstart a regex search<br></br>: /SECTION:<br></br>Which will easily allow me to jump to a section in the file. Thinking of single file programs with essentially really good navigation. </p>

<p > TODO: abrupt progression instead of smooth gradient. Gradients with stops and what not. </p>
<p > Questions:<br></br>Can I encode bezier animations in color? </p>
<p > Statement:<br></br>A print is a certain type of movement. </p>

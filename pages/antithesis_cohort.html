	<h1> Anti-Thesis Cohort? </h1>
<blockquote> <p> I will add more details here later... but for now... </p> </blockquote>
<p> Independent Workshop is a nomadic, collaboratively organized “thesis” cohort for those of us that are not taking the official class; it began as a solution to work around the current conditions of this year’s over-crowded thesis cohorts. </p>
<p> We work together to create a system of accountability that we would otherwise lack, and in the process, we run our own workshops, lock-in sessions, presentations, and general shenanigans. </p>
<p> We host guest Crits to get external feedback from people and hosted 3 of them til now. </p>
<p> Cohort members: Alexandra, Sanchari, Celine, Aiyana, Olivia, Nehir, Aaryan </p>

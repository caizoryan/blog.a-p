	<h1> Publication Engine </h1>
<blockquote> <p> I literally cannot think of a good name. </p> </blockquote>
<p> Here is an outline of my ongoing thesis project where I've been exploring the technical aspects of the typographical stack. + Investigating different ways of producing publication through writing programs. </p>
<p> This project started in about March of 2025. Although I would say I'd been experimenting with some of these concepts since my second year at OCAD U specifically Anthony Campea's TYPE 3 (2023) <a href="#footnote-anchor-0"  id="footnote-ref-0"> [1] </a>. For which I made this p5 based typesetting tool that gave words weight depending on their word length. </p>
<h3> Getting things off the ground </h3>
<p> Anyways. The project really started in its current form in March 2025 when I was doing an Independent Study with Roderick. I started off with writing an implementation for basic typesetting, with the idea that later I can intervene in this process and use it in interesting ways. </p>

<ul> <li> <p> also linked text boxes so words that overflow from one can go into the next. </p> </li> </ul>

<p class='caption'> First implementation of linked text boxes. </p>
<p> Eventually I also added hyphenation (can see below marked by red text), a simple column based grid and the ability to collect spreads together into a 'Book'. </p>

<p> At this point I was also heavily using Javascript classes to model all of this elements. I later revised them to be functions, which I will talk aboutlater. </p>

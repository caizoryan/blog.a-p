	<h1> Reflecting, Recaping and Wrapping up 2025 </h1>
<p class='insert'> A lot happened in 2025 and I made a lot of small, medium / large things. As this year is coming to a close, I wanted to take a step back and reflect on the things I made, where these things came from and where do they go next. </p>

<p class='date'> Jan 11 </p>
<p> <a href = "https://github.com/caizoryan/editor"> caizoryan/editor JavaScript  </a> Began this year with starting the 
<a class='feed-link' href = "https://feed.a-p.space/feed-editor-editor">
<span>(FEED)</span>&nbsp;editor-editor
</a> project. This was the prelimnary repo. Later renamed it to editor-editor </p>

<p class='date'> Jan 26 </p>
<p> <a href = "https://github.com/caizoryan/s-p-a-website"> caizoryan/s-p-a-website JavaScript  </a> Started the project s-p-a website for the last time. I've been making and remaking my parents website for the past 5 years. But never finishing. I finally finished it this year and they launched it! </p>

</div>

<p class='insert'> I have it somewhere in my drafts that I wanted to do a blog post about this invite website. This was the first time I did anything server related, where state is shared amongst multiple people. I also made the thing in 
<a class='feed-link' href = "https://feed.a-p.space/feed-editor-editor">
<span>(FEED)</span>&nbsp;editor-editor
</a> which was a big W. </p>

<p class='date'> Jan 30 </p>
<p> <a href = "https://github.com/caizoryan/editor-editor"> caizoryan/editor-editor JavaScript  </a> </p>
</div>

<p class='insert'> This was the repo I did most of my work in till about March of 2025. I started this repo because I was really interested in a recursive/bootstappable editor where the editor can implement itself over time + you can make components for specific domains. For instance see this component: </p>

<p> Added edges to the wave function tile component for <a href = ""> buffalo </a> </p>

<p class='insert'> that is a tile connections editor for a wave function collapse algorithm. Writing tiles directly to json is tedious, so this is essentially is a data editor. This was the idea behind the whole editor-editor. This issue ended up being that it felt very cumbersome to make changes. </p>
<p class='insert'> Reflection: I think the main issue with this project was that I tried to make it an end all be all. This project stems from the work I did in 2023 when I implemented an editor for the first time. Back then I though the issue was I was trying to make my own programming language and make the editor for that. The scope for the editor was much smaller then because the language was constrained. But the experience of using the editor was janky at best and that's why that didn't go forward. So to tackle that I tried making this editor a fully inclusive JS editor, with an LSP server + canvas implementation, filesystem, module loading and what not. I think it failed there because managing all these different parts was a lot. </p>

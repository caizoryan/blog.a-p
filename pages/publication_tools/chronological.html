<p> This project started in about March of 2025. Although I would say I'd been experimenting with some of these concepts since my second year at OCAD U specifically Anthony Campea's TYPE 3 (2023). For which I made this p5 based typesetting tool that gave words weight depending on their word length. </p>

<h3> Getting things off the ground </h3>
<p> Anyways. The project really started in its current form in March 2025 when I was doing an Independent Study with Roderick. I started off with writing an implementation for basic typesetting, with the idea that later I can intervene in this process and use it in interesting ways. </p>
<p> <video src=https://attachments.are.na/35440196/fb349e6c38e76bfcdc913a9d21ba7537.mp4?1742681746 controls loop></video>  </p>
<p> Plus(+) also linked text boxes so words that overflow from one can go into the next. </p>
<p> <video src=https://attachments.are.na/35462595/4cda268f3e505774242f8cbb2edea6f5.mp4?1742781867 controls loop></video>  </p>
<p class='caption'> First implementation of linked text boxes. </p>
<p> Eventually I also added hyphenation (can see below marked by red text), a simple column based grid and the ability to collect spreads together into a 'Book'. </p>
<p> <img src="https://images.are.na/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJhcmVuYV9pbWFnZXMiLCJrZXkiOiIzNTkzMTc3MC9vcmlnaW5hbF83Yzc2OTY5MGU4MjdiYTA1ZTkwMzYxZWFlMWRiOGJhNS5wbmciLCJlZGl0cyI6eyJyZXNpemUiOnsid2lkdGgiOjEyMDAsImhlaWdodCI6MTIwMCwiZml0IjoiaW5zaWRlIiwid2l0aG91dEVubGFyZ2VtZW50Ijp0cnVlfSwid2VicCI6eyJxdWFsaXR5Ijo3NX0sImpwZWciOnsicXVhbGl0eSI6NzV9LCJyb3RhdGUiOm51bGx9fQ==?bc=0" /> </p>
<p> At this point I was also heavily using Javascript classes to model all of this elements. I later revised them to be functions, which I will talk about later. </p>
<p> <video src=https://attachments.are.na/35931897/076ef52490459f8e6edd87be3d06828e.mp4?1744428133 controls loop></video>  </p>
<p> Another thing that isn't visible in the screen grabs is the management of DPI and Units. Essentially, I wanted to use typographic units, such as ems, picas, points and inches. And these units also need to correspond to the paper sizing. Plus, I was doing all of this in p5, which meant everything was raster, so it didn't print great unless you upscaled it to have about 300DPI which wouldn't fit on the screen and be really expensive and slow to draw. </p>
<p> Anyways, to circumvent all of this, I thought I should have a Scale object, which would have helper functions that would provide pixel values for any given DPI. Given that all elements use this Scale for positioning and sizing, everything would stay in proportion. Then it can be designed at a lower DPI and exported at a higher one. </p>
<p class='summary'> Implemented basic text formatting and layout. Then added a grid system to locate and position the items onto a page. Created a data structure/interface to save data and express these elements and finally a Scale that manages sizing for different DPIs. I was almost done. The only thing left to figure out was imposition. </p>
<h3> Imposition </h3>
<p> How do I turn 2D surfaces ~> Spreads into printable sheets that can be bound as a booklet. </p>
<p> <img src="https://images.are.na/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJhcmVuYV9pbWFnZXMiLCJrZXkiOiI0MzY0MTMyMS9vcmlnaW5hbF9hYjhiZDIxMmM1MGQ4NzI2MjFlY2JkODgzMzBjMzkyZC5qcGciLCJlZGl0cyI6eyJyZXNpemUiOnsid2lkdGgiOjEyMDAsImhlaWdodCI6MTIwMCwiZml0IjoiaW5zaWRlIiwid2l0aG91dEVubGFyZ2VtZW50Ijp0cnVlfSwid2VicCI6eyJxdWFsaXR5Ijo3NX0sImpwZWciOnsicXVhbGl0eSI6NzV9LCJyb3RhdGUiOm51bGx9fQ==?bc=0" /> </p>
<div class="two-col">

<p> This took some time to figure out. <video src=https://attachments.are.na/43641418/b95b290090840203dc8402808f6d0bcc.mp4?1771217450 controls loop></video>  </p>
<div>

<p> I had to simulate this process by moving pieces of paper around or drawing and making arrows to slowly understand what the pattern was. Once I did that a few times I was able to write some helper functions that given an array of page numbers: </p>
<pre>let pages = [
    [0, 1],
    [2, 3],
    [4, 5],
    [6, 7],
    [8, 9],
    [10,11],
    [12, 0]
]
</pre>
<p> Would return imposed pages like this </p>
<pre>let imposed = imposePages(pages)
/* imposed = [
    [12, 1],
    [2, 11],
    [4,  9],
    [6,  7],
    [8,  5],
    [10, 3]]
*/
</pre>
</div>

</div>

<p> I had a lot of fun figuring this imposition stuff out. Because it was a very tactile experience with programming and algorithms. And just how these numbers come together on paper to form that booklet is just so satisfying, and being able to undestand it through numbers in such an abstract sense is quite fun! </p>
<p> <img src="https://images.are.na/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJhcmVuYV9pbWFnZXMiLCJrZXkiOiI0MzY0MTMxOC9vcmlnaW5hbF9iNmJkYjBiMjE5MzQ2NDM3ODcwN2E4OGU0MWRjY2E5MS5wbmciLCJlZGl0cyI6eyJyZXNpemUiOnsid2lkdGgiOjEyMDAsImhlaWdodCI6MTIwMCwiZml0IjoiaW5zaWRlIiwid2l0aG91dEVubGFyZ2VtZW50Ijp0cnVlfSwid2VicCI6eyJxdWFsaXR5Ijo3NX0sImpwZWciOnsicXVhbGl0eSI6NzV9LCJyb3RhdGUiOm51bGx9fQ==?bc=0" /> </p>
<h4> Vertical Offsets </h4>
<p> With imposition figured out, I had all the first principles that are (probably) necessary for a publication software down. </p>
<p> It was time to intervene! </p>
<p> Naturally, since I had just spend so much time trying to figure out imposition, that's where I ended up intervening. </p>
<div class="two-col">

<p> <video src=https://attachments.are.na/36148752/d92c25feeff8694a642becc15f9975fc.mp4?1745270231 controls loop></video>  </p>

</div>

<p> So the first idea I had was, to take sheets and offset them by some amount vertically. This is the finaly booklet that I submitted for my ISP and its interface counterpart. </p>
<div class="two-col">

<p> <video src=https://attachments.are.na/38994296/b6c0b19cd430a43794280870f8db99ca.mp4?1756038199 controls loop></video>  </p>

</div>

<h4> Horizontal Offsets </h4>
<p> Over the summer I had the chance to work on a menu design for a restaurant. So I took this opportunity to explore what horizontal offsets would look like (in terms of implementation). </p>
<p> The horizontal offsets were a little harder to implement. Because offsetting a sheet will change the dimensions of the spreads it is a part of. So managing that was a hassle. But eventually I was able to figure it out <a href="#footnote-anchor-0"  id="footnote-ref-0"> [geometry] </a>. </p>
<p> <video src=https://attachments.are.na/40566557/7b31b1807a182d5b41f6229e2d5aeea1.mp4?1761321390 controls loop></video>  </p>
<p> Overall I also didn't have as much trouble as I thought with sizing and printing upscaled raster type. And somehow everything worked out pretty well. </p>
<p> The production was much more intensive though. Since unlike trimming regular publications -- where you can trim all the pages together after theyre bound -- with this menu I had to trim them all before binding and correctly bind them together with the offsets.<br></br><img src="https://images.are.na/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJhcmVuYV9pbWFnZXMiLCJrZXkiOiI0MzY1ODg5OS9vcmlnaW5hbF8wMmE3MmQzYmJmOTM0YTE1MTcwMWZiYjg3Yzk0NDY0Mi5wbmciLCJlZGl0cyI6eyJyZXNpemUiOnsid2lkdGgiOjEyMDAsImhlaWdodCI6MTIwMCwiZml0IjoiaW5zaWRlIiwid2l0aG91dEVubGFyZ2VtZW50Ijp0cnVlfSwid2VicCI6eyJxdWFsaXR5Ijo3NX0sImpwZWciOnsicXVhbGl0eSI6NzV9LCJyb3RhdGUiOm51bGx9fQ==?bc=0" /><br></br><video src=https://attachments.are.na/43658913/6b54481996bf541d09c18d1557e95a3d.mp4?1771269994 controls loop></video>  </p>

<h3> Off-track "Book" structural studies </h3>

<h3> Raster Limitations (switch to PDF) </h3>
<p> I worked on a booklet project with Craig towards the end of the fall semester. </p>

<p> The project was generally really simple, but it put my publication stack to the test. How well could it handle typesetting about 8000 words. Turns out the finer details weren't great and the rags were all over the place, but other than that it was a pretty good outcome considering it was designed and fabricated in 4 days. </p>

<p> Here is where the issues with raster exports began. Up until now I wasn't really paying attention how accurate the size would be when it was printed. I assumed as long as the ratios are correct, I could just print JPEG files and just fit them to the paper. For the most part this method worked, till it came the time to print this specific project. Because the spreads were imposed on the 11x17 with two spreads on each side -- to minimize the amount of cuts that are needed, the spreads had to be be correctly positioned when printed -- which they were not, off by about 1/2 an inch at its worst and about 1/16th of an inch at best. </p>
<p> This experience sort of made me look into PDF exports. Which turned out to be easier than I thought. Instead of using p5.js, I could switch it out for <a href = "https://pdfkit.org/"> pdfkit </a>. I wrote a compatibility layer so it could be rendered on HTML canvas through p5.js but can be saved as a PDF. </p>
<p> With PDF also came some nice affordances, like being able to use spot color! </p>

<p> I think the outcome is not that great looking, but it technically worked and I was able to specify spot colors and the printshop was able to print it. </p>
<p class='summary'> Tried some conditional typesetting, finer details like baseline shifts, indents and character styles. Implemented 2-UP imposition which exposed limitations of printing JPEGS, eventually made the move to working with PDFs </p>
<h3> Rotating the spine (Fold) </h3>
<p> I offsetted the spine vertically and then horizontally, so at this point it felt the logical next thing would be to rotate the spine. </p>

<p> So anyways, I had to figure out how to make this fold stuff work. And to do that I had to solve this simple problem: </p>
<blockquote> <p> Given a fold line on a sheet of paper, find how the paper would fold. </p> </blockquote>
<p> <img src="https://images.are.na/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJhcmVuYV9pbWFnZXMiLCJrZXkiOiI0MTgzMTc1NS9vcmlnaW5hbF80ZmQ2MDgxNDIwMmYwYzIxYTg1ZDk1NjNmMTQ3OGVmMS5wbmciLCJlZGl0cyI6eyJyZXNpemUiOnsid2lkdGgiOjEyMDAsImhlaWdodCI6MTIwMCwiZml0IjoiaW5zaWRlIiwid2l0aG91dEVubGFyZ2VtZW50Ijp0cnVlfSwid2VicCI6eyJxdWFsaXR5Ijo3NX0sImpwZWciOnsicXVhbGl0eSI6NzV9LCJyb3RhdGUiOm51bGx9fQ==?bc=0" /> </p>
<p> So calculate the vector coordinates for the two quads (separated by fold line) after one of them is reflected over the fold line. </p>
<p> It took me quite some time to figure this out because I was not very attentive  during high school. I had to go back to high school math, and re-learn all the stuff I slept through. Revised on how to find perpendicular lines, what the slope/gradient of a line means. Then constructing triangles using perpendicular line, using triangles (soh cah toa) properties to calculate the reflected points, and so much more <a href="#footnote-anchor-2"  id="footnote-ref-2"> [fun] </a>. </p>

<p> After bunch and bunch of failed attempts I got something like this working. Even after getting this working I had to tweak some stuff because it wouldn't work for all directions and what not. </p>
</div>

<p> Then once I had this working for a single fold, I was like cool, let me try for two folds! </p>
<p> <video src=https://attachments.are.na/41831797/edd7b7ee953461f05c89d140285d8028.mp4?1765866815 controls loop></video>  </p>
<p> And that worked by just incrementally reflecting all the points past a fold and iterating through them... Eventually made it so I can edit foldlines and have multiple lines. </p>

<p> And then finally, given a printed surface with say some image or graphic on it, how would the graphic look folded up given the fold lines. This one was more tough than I thought and it still break sometimes if the angle of rotation is more than 180 degrees, which I need to figure out how to fix. But still it looks so awesome and feels gratifying! </p>

<p> "Although its funny cause when I print it out and fabricate it... it just feels like... oh cool you printed on a long piece of paper and folded it up :) I shall figure out some use case for this now that I've implemented it :P " ~ December 2025 </p>
<p> Eventually after I let this project marinate in my head for a while... I thought about how folds are more intuitive to do physically -- but by that logic I would have done this for nothing. But then I thought about it more, and came to the conclusion -- folds are more intuitive to do physically (yes) and also interesting to iterate computationally (oh). So I can think of the folding paper as an Interface <a href="#footnote-anchor-3"  id="footnote-ref-3"> [interface] </a>. </p>

<p class='summary'> Did a project that explicitly explains step-wise execution of typesetting program. </p>
<h3> Interface & Techical Detour </h3>
<blockquote> <p> If you aren't interested in the programmatic aspects, feel free to skip to the <a href = "#graphical-interface"> Graphical Interface </a> part </p> </blockquote>
<p> While investigating the typographical stack, I was simultaneously also having a tangential explortation -- interface. </p>
<p> For the most part of the project, I didn't have a graphical interface. Whatever I was making, I was hardcoding it into a Javascript files. Here are some excerpts from how the code is structured underneath, or this is how the programatic interface looked like. </p>
<p> To create the scale, we initalize the class with a DPI </p>
<pre>let s = new Scale(150)

// and then use it to get px values
let fourInches = s.inch(4) // 4*150 = 600px
</pre>
<p> This is how the grid structure is defined: </p>
<pre>export let grid = new Grid({
	page_width: s.inch(9.5),
	page_height: s.inch(6.5),

	margin: {
		top: s.em(2),
		bottom: s.em(2),
		inside: s.em(1),
		outside: s.em(2),
	},

	columns: 8,
	gutter: s.point(6),
	hanglines: [
		s.em(3),
		s.em(6),
		s.em(9),
		s.em(12),
	],
})
</pre>
<p> And then we can use the grid structure to position a text frame on a page, you could write it as a nested array: </p>
<pre>let frame = ["TextFrame",
    ["text", "Text on column 2 on Verso"],
    ["font_family", fonts.ouma],
    ["height", ["em", 12]],
    ["y", ["hangline", 1]],
    ["x", ["verso",  2]],
]
</pre>
<p> Paragraph styles are defined like this </p>
<pre>export let paragraphStyles = {
	"+:title": {
		font_weight: 500,
		font_family: "stolzl",
		font_size: s.point(17),
		leading: s.point(21)
	},
	"+:comment": {
		font_weight: 300,
		font_family: "freight-macro-pro",
		font_size: s.point(9),
		leading: s.point(10),
	}
}
</pre>
<p> And can be activated by using them in text like this: </p>
<pre>let frame = ["TextFrame",
    ["text", "+:comment Text on column 2 on Verso"],
    ["y", ["hangline", 1]],
    ["x", ["verso",  2]],
]
</pre>
<h3> Graphical Interface </h3>
<p> Even though the grid positioning makes it much easier to put things on a page, I still needed some form of a graphical interface, not only because it would be more intuitive, but that it also gives me more opportunities to utilise interfaces in interesting ways <a href="#footnote-anchor-4"  id="footnote-ref-4"> [2] </a>. </p>
<p> My first attempt at an interface for this tool was for a virtual book that I made. This was my Workshop Proposal for our <a href = "../antithesis_cohort.html"> Anti-thesis cohort </a>. </p>
<p> <video src=https://attachments.are.na/43667811/3bee77836d560aaaddaa58e6286e7022.mp4?1771287661 controls loop></video>  </p>
<p> As it is evident, all the interface does is makes the nested Array structure into an html interface. So it doesn't add much other than a shorter feedback loop for positioning items and such. Rather it is a downgrade because now I'm unable to use the affordances I have from programming with this (such as for loops, using variables, etc). </p>
<p> To overcome this I started adding keywords that would invoke functions. So the nested Array structure turned into a Lisp. </p>
<p> <video src=https://attachments.are.na/43668008/0bd334914631ee0c6cec1fd576478dcc.mp4?1771288227 controls loop></video>  </p>
<p> For instance, </p>
<pre>TextFrame({
    text: "hello world",
    x: multiply(Math.random(), inch(4)),
    y: inch(2),
})
</pre>
<p> Could be written as </p>
<pre>["TextFrame", "{}",
  ["text", "hello world"],
  ["x", ["mul", "rand", ["inch", 4]]],
  ["y", ["inch", 2]],
]
</pre>
<p> <video src=https://attachments.are.na/43668080/eed4fae607324b77aa6d8d58dfe849a0.mp4?1771288539 controls loop></video>  </p>
<p> And then I iterated on this a bunch. At this point I wanted this to be a <a href = "https://scratch.mit.edu/"> scratch </a> or <a href = "https://fructure-editor.tumblr.com/"> fructure </a> type software. </p>
<p> <video src=https://attachments.are.na/41015241/9727d5d85f392a11fca1f6600619d150.mp4?1762836975 controls loop></video> <br></br><video src=https://attachments.are.na/41014081/5b16e9b64337a77f5f4365ad86d81453.mp4?1762833876 controls loop></video>  </p>
<h4> Loops </h4>

<p> Initially I was trying to restrict myself from involving the mouse in these interfaces and was wondering if I could find interesting patterns of working with form if I stuck to keyboard only editing. Although I came to the conclusion that this was a foolish idea <a href="#footnote-anchor-5"  id="footnote-ref-5"> [4] </a>. </p>
<p> However I still wanted to keep the constraint of not having elements draggable on the canvas itself. I wanted to maintain the dataness of the elements on the screen. What I mean to say is, <em> I want the elements to be a result of data </em> rather than the elements being able to control the data (moving them mutates their x and y positions). </p>

<p class='caption'> Initial sketch for how I could incorporate mouse controlled elements to this existing UI. </p>

<p class='caption'> First implementation for this. </p>
<p> After implementing this, I realised that managing the layout with this kind of UI in a static sidebar is going to be a giant pain. It could work decently for small stuff like the above example, but if this composition got complex it would be a pain to navigate. </p>
<p> I kept going back to the UI's of Max MSP, Pure Data, Grasshoper or even Touch Designer. Eventually I decided to turn the whole structure into a node based canvas UI. </p>

<p> Text updates when you change it :) </p>
<p> As it may or may not be evident from the videos, data flows from one node to another, which takes the data it recieves and transforms it in its programmed way and sends it forward. Most imporantly, <strong> It can have any UI to reflect and edit its state. </strong> This is the primary  PRO of this approach <a href="#footnote-anchor-6"  id="footnote-ref-6"> [pure-functions] </a>. </p>
<p class='summary'> Did some basic interfaces and slowly progressed to a node based interface. Currently struggling with making the node based interface intuitive and easy to navigate around. </p>
<h3> Going Forward </h3>
<p> The most common critique I've gotten in the last few weeks is that "Everything looks interesting (breadth) but nothing looks explored (depth)". Which points me to making more outcomes. I think I've been too caught up with the development part, and I would leave things behind the second they started working, as if to say "problem solved". I need to go back and tie up all these knots by utilising the systems that I have devised to make some cool stuff! </p>
<p> Also what I need to work on is the presentation. How can I communicate to someone who has never seen this project what this project is (?) </p>
<p> It seemed like I needed some anchors. What is this project about? It's an exploration of the typographical stack... What is the typographical stack? </p>
<p> <img src="https://images.are.na/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJhcmVuYV9pbWFnZXMiLCJrZXkiOiI0MzkyNDAwOC9vcmlnaW5hbF8zZWEyM2EwNmVkMDE3ZTI1OTljNzQzMzZkY2YxMjg4YS5wbmciLCJlZGl0cyI6eyJyZXNpemUiOnsid2lkdGgiOjEyMDAsImhlaWdodCI6MTIwMCwiZml0IjoiaW5zaWRlIiwid2l0aG91dEVubGFyZ2VtZW50Ijp0cnVlfSwid2VicCI6eyJxdWFsaXR5Ijo3NX0sImpwZWciOnsicXVhbGl0eSI6NzV9LCJyb3RhdGUiOm51bGx9fQ==?bc=0" /> </p>
<p> I'm thinking of fitting the work I have done into these four categories. And more importantly making more work (more books, posters, videos, websites and such) that explain all of this stuff. </p>
<p> I kind of also think I have work that is made possible due to these categories, and there is work that evidently explains these categories. For instance, I think this menu project... </p>
<p> <img src="https://images.are.na/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJhcmVuYV9pbWFnZXMiLCJrZXkiOiI0MDk1NzQxMi9vcmlnaW5hbF80NzE2NGI1ZmNjNGM4Nzg4ZTNjYTYwNzViN2VkZDFkZS5qcGciLCJlZGl0cyI6eyJyZXNpemUiOnsid2lkdGgiOjEyMDAsImhlaWdodCI6MTIwMCwiZml0IjoiaW5zaWRlIiwid2l0aG91dEVubGFyZ2VtZW50Ijp0cnVlfSwid2VicCI6eyJxdWFsaXR5Ijo3NX0sImpwZWciOnsicXVhbGl0eSI6NzV9LCJyb3RhdGUiOm51bGx9fQ==?bc=0" /> </p>
<p> ... is a good example for the imposition category and explains what the domain of imposition is, but also is enabled by paragraph and structure but doesn't explain them. So I think I need to find a mediation, or a way to put these projects into their boxes... or maybe I need to distinguish work that is just work in itself and work that explains the larger project. </p>
<p class='summary'> Going forward I need to utilise these systems to show what kinds of form they are capable of making as well as make things specifically to explain the project. I'm thinking of using the categories, "Letter", "Paragraph", "Structure" and "Imposition" to section out the work so that it can be digested a bit easier by an audience that is viewing the work for the first time. </p>
